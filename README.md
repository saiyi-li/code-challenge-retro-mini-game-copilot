## Theme & Visual Style

- Use a nostalgic 16-bit, early 90s retro graphics style.
- Implement pixel art for characters, coins, and backgrounds.
- Keep on-screen text minimal and use pixelated or blocky fonts.
- Generate simple sprite art and background images using AI.
- Incorporate MYOB brand colors (particularly MYOB purple) subtly into game elements.
- Design coins with MYOB purple coloration and integrate brand elements into platforms.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

- Design an endless runner with continuous scrolling and no backward movement.
- Control a player character that jumps to dodge obstacles and collect floating coins.
- Coins increase the score, while colliding with enemies ends the game.
- Gradually increase the game's speed and difficulty as time passes.

## Optional Features

- Introduce power-ups after collecting a certain number of coins.
- Power-ups grant temporary speed boosts or invincibility.

## Game Over

- Display a retro-styled “Game Over” screen showing the score.
- Provide an option to restart the game.

## Technical Requirements

- Develop using HTML5 Canvas for 2D rendering.
- Ensure it runs smoothly in modern desktop browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
- Avoid using heavy frameworks, opting for vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight framework like Phaser.
- Keep asset file sizes small.
- Test for browser compatibility and ensure the game scales properly to different screen sizes.
- Deployment should be easy, runnable via a simple HTML file.

## Tools & AI Assistance

- Use AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to boost productivity.
- Generate art assets using AI where possible.
- Maintain clear project organization, potentially using .cursorrules if working with Cursor.
- Adhere to good code practices with clear naming and comments.
