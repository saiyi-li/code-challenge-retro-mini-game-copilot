## Development Task Checklist

### 1. Project Setup and Structure

- [x] Create basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- [x] Set up Canvas element and basic rendering context
- [x] Establish responsive design for different screen sizes
- [x] Create folder structure for assets, sprites, and scripts

### 2. Asset Generation and Collection

- [x] Generate character sprite(s) with animation frames
- [x] Create obstacle/enemy sprites
- [x] Design coin sprites with animation
- [x] Generate background elements and layers for parallax scrolling
- [x] Create pixelated font or find suitable retro font
- [x] Generate power-up sprites (if implementing optional features)

### 3. Game Logic Implementation

- [x] Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Create player character with jump mechanics
- [x] Implement endless scrolling background with parallax effect
- [x] Add obstacle generation and movement
- [x] Create collision detection system
- [x] Implement score tracking with coin collection
- [x] Add difficulty progression (increased speed over time)
- [x] Develop Game Over state and restart functionality

### 5. Optional Features Implementation

- [x] Design power-up mechanics (speed boost, invincibility)
- [x] Implement power-up spawning logic
- [x] Create visual effects for active power-ups

### 6. UI Development

- [x] Create score display in retro pixel style
- [x] Design and implement start screen
- [x] Create Game Over screen with final score
- [x] Add restart button functionality
- [x] Implement basic instructions or tutorial element

### 7. Testing and Optimization

- [x] Test performance across different browsers
- [x] Optimize asset loading and game performance
- [x] Ensure responsive design works on various screen sizes
- [x] Conduct playability testing and adjust difficulty
- [x] Optimize asset file sizes

### 8. Final Polishing

- [ ] Add visual polish (particles, effects, animations)
- [ ] Refine game difficulty progression
- [ ] Ensure code quality with clear comments and organization
- [ ] Create final documentation
